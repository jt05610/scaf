# Summary

There is an urgent need for productivity and automation tools for bench scientists in the life sciences. Bench
scientists still overwhelmingly rely on manual labor and spreadsheet-based data analysis to perform their work,
resulting in slow and wasteful drug development, poor quality datasets, and high burnout rates. While there are tools available for automating
common laboratory tasks, it is impossible to automate everything with one tool. In contrast, the artificial
intelligence (AI) field has enjoyed exponential growth, largely driven by the accessibility and availability of quality open-source tools.

If someone wants to implement AI into their work, they do not have to implement libraries to perform all the linear
algebra involved -- they just download open-source tools which have been developed by thousands of experts. If a bench
scientist wants to implement a new lab process such as an assay or chemical reaction, however, they still must learn how
to perform every step of the process.

A key component in the rapid growth in the artificial intelligence (AI) field is the availability of quality open-source
tools. If a
